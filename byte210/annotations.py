Bite 210. Add Type Annotations

Continuing from where we left off in Bite 209, use the docstring you wrote in last Bite to add type annotations to
the sum_numbers function.

Note that you will need to import one of the types from the typing module. Again no need to implement the function.
It's about typing here. Have fun!
