Bite 101. f-strings and a simple if/else

In this Bite we'll get you to calculate whether a person is able to drive or not based on their minimum age which is
stored in the constant MIN_DRIVING_AGE.

Print (not return) name is allowed to drive or name is not allowed to drive (note there is no period (.) at the end),
based on the age being equal or greater than MIN_DRIVING_AGE. """

       checking the passed in age against the MIN_DRIVING_AGE constant"""
