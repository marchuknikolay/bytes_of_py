Bite 103. Loop through a dictionary and pluralise a word

You're given a dictionary of people and the number of games they've won. Use a for loop to iterate over the
dictionary and print out the users name and how many games they've won in the following format: sara has won n games
To make it human readable, pluralise the word game to suit the number of games won.

    """Loop through games_won's dict (key, value) pairs (dict.items)
       printing (print, not return) how many games each person has won,

       bob has won 1 game

       is retained so no sorting is required for this Bite.)
