"""
Bite 16. PyBites date generator

Write a generator that returns special dates for PyBites:

Every year mark counting from PYBITES_BORN date (so 19th of Dec 2017, 19th of Dec 2018, etc) Every 100 days mark
counting from PYBITES_BORN (29th of March 2017, 7th of July 2017, etc) See the tests for more details how your code
will be tested: as this is a beginner's challenge we only calculate a few years ahead, leaving the next leap year (
2020) out of this challenge.

We will revisit this in an intermediate challenge. Have fun!
