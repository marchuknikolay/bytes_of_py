Bite 17. Form teams from a group of friends

Write a function called friends_teams that takes a list of friends, a team_size (type int, default=2) and
order_does_matter (type bool, default False).

Return all possible teams. Hint: if order matters (order_does_matter=True), the number of teams would be greater.

See the tests for more details. Enjoy :)
