"""
Bite 225. Swap case PyBites characters

In this Bite you will swap case all pybites characters (both lower- and upper case) for a given text.

Not much more as for our instruction, just complete convert_pybites_chars which should work like this:

>>> from convert_chars import convert_pybites_chars
>>> text = "Today we added TWO NEW Bites to our Platform, exciting!"
>>> convert_pybites_chars(text)
'todaY wE addEd tWO NeW bITES To our plaTform, ExcITIng!'

(Note that all converted chars are in the string pybites)

Have fun and code more Python!
