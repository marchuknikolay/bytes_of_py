"""
Bite 25. No promo twice, keep state in a class

In this bite a real world scenario: PyBites has a growing set of Bites and gives away promos. They choose a Bite
randomly but don't want to choose the same one again.

Hence you are provided with a BITES constant and a bites_done set that gets passed into the class via its
constructor. Complete the methods in the Promo class:
1. _pick_random_bite is a helper (_ here means private) that picks a randomly available Bite. When no more Bites are
available raise a NoBitesAvailable (provided).
2. new_bite should use this helper and update self.bites_done (it keeps state, the reason we used a class here).

See also the tests. We hope you learn a thing or two. Enjoy!
