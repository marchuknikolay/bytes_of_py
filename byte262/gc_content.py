Bite 262. GC content

The DNA of all organsims consists of the letters (bases) A, C, T and G. Every organism has a different ratio of these
bases, known as the GC content. This information can not only give clues about the origin of genetic material but can
also help to determine how closely related some organisms are.

For the given DNA sequences calculate the GC content as a percentage of all (allowed) bases (=percentage of the
letters G or C).

Example:
DNA Sequence:
AAAAAAAATTTTTTGGGGCC
A=8, T=6, G=4, C=2, TOTAL = 20
GC content = n(G|C) / n(A|C|G|T) = 6/20 = 3/10 => 30%
